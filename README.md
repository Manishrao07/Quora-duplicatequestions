********Quora-Questions-duplicate_pair_checker********

This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focuses on identifying whether two given questions are semantically similar,
i.e., if they are asking the same thing despite possibly being phrased differently. This is a classic duplicate question detection problem often seen in platforms like Quora or Stack Overflow.
The main goal is to build a model that can determine if two questions are duplicates by analyzing their linguistic and contextual similarity using a combination of traditional NLP techniques and machine learning.
